                            The Kadax.pl website project was created as part of my work at Netfox. With a significant
                            increase in sales of the Kadax brand's assortment, consisting mainly of home and garden
                            accessories, there was a need to move away from e-commerce portals (mainly Amazon and
                            Allegro), where the brand had reigned so far, in order to maximize profits. Netfox's design
                            department was therefore given the task of designing the online shop, both visually and in
                            terms of systems.</p>

                            Our goal was to create a website that would be an easier and more pleasant way of shopping
                            for Kadax's products than using e-commerce portals. The challenge was to design a website
                            that would take into account the pre-imposed requirements for content and needed functions
                            while improving the shopping experience.</p>

                        As part of our design process for the Kadax.pl website project, we conducted a comprehensive
                        competitive analysis of about 40 brand websites that were direct competitors of Kadax. Our aim
                        was to pick out good and bad design patterns, in particular their product categorisation and
                        navigation system. This analysis helped us identify the strengths and weaknesses of other
                        e-commerce sites. As a result, we were able to identify best practices to implement in our
                        website design.

                        To ensure that the site we design meets the needs of our customers, we analysed Kadax's sales
                        data from Amazon
                        and Allegro, two major e-commerce portals. We researched the demographics of their customers,
                        which gave us valuable insights into what works best for our target audience. With this data, we
                        were able to make confident decisions about how to structure and present products to our
                        customers.

                        We created two personas, Barbara, an elderly lady, and Stefan, a middle-aged man, to understand
                        the user's perspective and create user-centred designs. We developed user stories for them,
                        outlining their goals, motivations and frustrations when shopping online. This helped us tailor
                        the website design to their specific needs and ensure that their experience on the site was
                        enjoyable.

                    <p class="article-content">
                        To optimise the user experience, we created user flows for both personas. These user flows
                        showed the path each persona would take to achieve their goals, from entering the site to making
                        a purchase. By understanding the user's journey and goals, we were able to optimise the site's
                        navigation and make it easy for users to find what they were looking for.

                    <p class="article-content">
                        We started wireframing inside Figma, using our user flows as a guide. We started with the main
                        page and the layout and order of products and required elements, then moved on to the menu, sub
                        pages and filtering. We also designed icons for all the categories on the site. Using our
                        wireframes, we were able to quickly turn our sketches into high-fidelity prototypes.

                    <p class="article-content">
                        We used Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype of the site. We had to take into account that
                        the site would be based on the Magento engine, which limited our options. Despite this, we were
                        able to create a visually pleasing design that was easy to use. Our ability to work on
                        components played an important part in our design workflow, allowing us to make subsequent
                        changes and iterations quickly.

                        To make sure our prototype was user-friendly, we conducted usability tests with our colleagues
                        and friends. We wanted to see if they could easily navigate the prototype and make a purchase
                        without encountering any problems. The feedback we received allowed us to make the necessary
                        improvements before delivering the final product.

                        After the official launch of the site, we continued to work with the developers to identify and
                        fix any hiccups and fill in any gaps. We were quick to point out any errors or problems and
                        suggest solutions. We made sure the site was constantly improving and meeting the needs of our
                        customers.
