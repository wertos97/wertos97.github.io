                            The year 2020 was a successful year for the pet industry in Poland.
                            Many Polish families, seeking to fight pandemic loneliness, decided to adopt or buy a pet.
                            However, carers lacked a comprehensive tool that would make it easier for them to gain
                            knowledge about their pet and share it with other caregivers. By designing our app, we

                    <p class="article-content">Social transformation is shaping many areas of human life. Dynamic
                        technological changes and growing environmental concerns are contributing to changing
                        perceptions of human impact on the planet and the well-being of living creatures. This is
                        reflected not only in philosophical trends but also in people's everyday lives. The awareness of
                        animal protection and the attitude towards pets is also increasing among Poles. Almost 3/4 of
                        pet owners say that they take care of their pet's health just as they do their own, and consider
                        animals to be members of their family.</p>

                Using publicly available data as part of our desk research, we found that pets
                are increasingly becoming real family members for Poles, rather than tools for chasing away strangers or
                catching mice. According to the survey, 40% of Poles have a dog or cat at home. 85% consider their pet a
                member of the family and 70% say that their pet's health is as important as their own.
                We decided to ask pet guardians and owners of temporary homes about their knowledge of pet care, the
                challenges they face, how they look after the health of their charges, how they organise the care of
                their pets and how they gather and share information about the animal. We chose individual in-depth
                interviews (IDIs) as the main research method, supported by the techniques of scale, visualisation, card
                sorting and imagination. Five carers and five sheltered housing owners took part in the study.
                We also carried out competitive analysis and benchmarking, focusing on health care, planning and the
                features that other apps encourage users to use.</p>

                    Conclusions and recommendations
                    The survey showed that our two target groups - carers and owners of temporary homes - are very
                    different. Caregivers are a much broader group, so we decided to focus on them, with a particular
                    emphasis on help with care and information sharing, and on the health and availability of vets. We
                    have
                    discarded areas that are already heavily marketed or that require us to have specialist knowledge.

                    Based on the data collected in the first phase, we created the persona of Karol - a husband,
                    father and carer of a dog and two cats. Karol's needs are to remember vet appointments and
                    vaccinations, and to monitor the health of the cats. He also wants to teach his children about
                    responsible pet care. Karol is frustrated by the amount of information he has to provide, the
                    forgetfulness of others so that he is the one who has to remember his responsibilities to the
                    animals, and health problems with one of the cats that also occur on weekends and holidays.

                after a vet visit, monitors the dog's weight, and checks how their family members are doing with the
                assigned tasks. We created a user path for each scenario. We also defined the information architecture
                of the application.</p>

                    For each of the 5 scenarios, we made paper sketches of the user wireflow. During the workshops,
                    using the Design Studio method, we worked out the best solutions for key elements of the
                    application, such as the bottom menu, calendar view or sub-page navigation elements, and the content
                    of the main user screen.</p>

                Using the finished prototype, we conducted usability tests of our app with 10 people. We mainly
                wanted
                to test users' first contact with the app, task creation and assignment, the concept of the pet
                health
                e-book, and activity measurement and summaries. The tests helped us to identify 2 critical bugs
                (preventing task completion), 4 major bugs (significantly hindering goal achievement) and 4 minor
                bugs
                (whose removal improved the user experience) in our prototype.</p>

                <p class="article-desc-header-small">Critical errors and their solutions</p>
                <p class="article-content">
                    The first critical bug was the behaviour of the drop-down list, which did not hide after
                    scrolling,
                    thus
                    obscuring another checkbox. As a result, users would unknowingly skip entering this data. We
                    corrected
                    this by automatically collapsing the list when moving to the next field.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">
                    The second critical bug was the unclear marking of tasks as completed - users' success was based
                    on
                    searching rather than deliberate action. We solved this by describing the checkbox and including
                    this
                    functionality in the onboarding. As suggested by users, we also added the ability to undo task
                    completion.</p>

                During the testing phase the app has received a lot of positive feedback. Users were describing the
                app
                as
                clean and easy to learn. Each of them found their way through the app without stutters or doubts and
                they were finding
                proposed solutions and functionalities useful and interesting.</p>
